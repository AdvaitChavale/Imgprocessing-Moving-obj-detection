# Imgprocessing-Moving-obj-detection

Hey ! I m learning image processing and I learnt how access the web cam of ur system and then find the moving object in the field. 
I m glad to share the the progress with you ! 

Change the line of code-


vs = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
as 0,1 or 2 
If u are getting errors in the code.

Run the file with Python 3.7.8 version 
To install-

Go to cmd prompt => Open as admin => write 'pip install python==3.7.8' 

I simply suggests what type of webcam you want to use.....enjoy !
